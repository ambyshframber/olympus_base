"I need a go/no-go for launch. ACO?"

"Go."

"Booster?"

"Go."

Sweating.

"EECOM?"

"Go."

"FAO?"

"Go."

"FIDO?"

Heavy breathing.

"Go."

"GUIDO?"

"Go."

"Payload?"

"Go." Moz' voice trembled slightly.

"PROP?"

"Go."

"CAPCOM is go, we are go for launch in T-minus five minutes."

Five minutes turned into four, which turned into one, which turned into 30 seconds. Before Moz or Kat had a chance to think about it, the countdown was at 12.

"Ignition!" From beneath the capsule, there came a low rumble, which steadily increased in amplitude until it became an all-encompassing roar. The launch clamps detached from the rocket, and they were airborne.

The next one minute and 58 seconds consisted of noise and gruelling acceleration. Moz could barely think under the force of three gees pushing him into the acceleration couch, and he was sure Kat didn't have it much better. Just as he thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, the boosters separated, and the force dropped to something manageable. Free of the crushing weight, Moz managed to get a few words out. "Kat, you doing good?"

"All I can say is Jesus Christ." He couldn't see her face, but he could guess what she looked like.

Hornsbury came on the radio. "First stage separation complete. Second stage separation in three minutes."

"Copy," Moz replied. The acceleration began to slowly increase again. Luckily, Moz didn't have to pilot the rocket: ground control were flying the entire thing by wire.

Nine minutes after takeoff, the final two members of Crew Three had reached orbit.
