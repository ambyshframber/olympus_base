"wombat559 asks, do you ever get bored up there?" Kat scratched the back of her neck. "Uhh... well, there's bored and there's bored. On a day to day level, no. There's over fifty years of Foundation experience in this tin can, so we've all got stories to tell. And on top of that, most of us are scientists. Moz has a degree in high-energy physics, and he's studying cosmic ray interactions; Nikolina is studying the effects of long-term isolation; Sahar is researching how fungi grow in microgravity - there's always something cool going on." She pushed off the wall, taking the laptop with her. "In fact, if I take you in here..." She entered a side compartment of the vessel, where Sahar was working. "Here she is! Say hi to the internet!"

Sahar turned to face Kat, surprised at the sudden interruption. "Hello, internet!"

Kat panned the camera over the tanks full of mushrooms and algae, before pushing back out of the room. "But on a higher, longer term level... also no. When you work for the Foundation you spend a lot of time cooped up in underground bunkers, seeing the same people day in, day out. You get used to it after the first year or so." She watched the chat scroll by for a few seconds, looking for another question.

"Sandford Primary School want to know how we get food. Well, we're lucky that Sahar is on board, because that's her area of expertise. She's made a video about how it all works, and it's going on the Foundation's website in the next few days. And for those of you higher up in education, she's delivering a talk - virtually of course - next week."

"How does the Ansible work? I'm not at liberty to say." She smiled into the camera. "Mainly because I wasn't listening when they explained, but that's besides the point."
